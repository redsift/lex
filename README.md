# Lex [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/redsift/lex)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/redsift/lex) [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/redsift/lex?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/redsift/lex)

Lex is adaptable lexer based on (almost borrowed from) [Lexical Scanning in Go](https://talks.golang.org/2011/lex.slide#1) talk given by Rob Pike on GTUG at Syndey on August 2011

## Status

The API is quite stable, and the package has been used in couple other projects being in production, but I consider its status as Work-In-Progress

## TODO

    - Add unit tests/sample
    - Support io.Reader as a source
